## Submission Instructions

### Overview
This project will be a source to help dungeon masters (DM's) plan and track encounters in a 5e DnD game. The app will allow DM's to create and save player characters (PC's) for use in multiple encounters. They will also be able to pull in any monster in the official 5e monster manual. The app will then calculate their turn order and display the PC's and monsters in order. The turn order will show who is "up" in rotation and allow for rotating through the roster of combatants. The app will also include some simple information to make combat flow smoother like health tracking and AC values. 
### Features
User login: Users will be able to create accounts in order to save characters and encounters

Character Creation: Users will be able to create player characters and custom monsters to use in encounters. These will be saved so they can re-use them if they have logged in.

Search: Users can search through 5e monsters to add to their encounter

Encounter building: Users will be able to add their player characters and monsters to custom encounters which can be saved to come back to

Iniative Tracking: App will calculate initiative order based on 5e default rules and display combatants in order

Encounter Helpers: User can use the built encounter to track current position in turn order, health totals, and AC values.
